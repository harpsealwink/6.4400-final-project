I tested my code on macOS. I edit my code in VSCode and compile and run my code through terminal.

I received guidance from TAs in office hours on the setup for the initial simple system with the sphere that goes in a circle. 

I mostly relied on trial-and-error, Piazza, and Stack Overflow for debugging errors; there weren't any particular websites I found helpful.

There are no known errors with my code.

I implemented a way to emulate a gentle breeze. While the key "W" is pressed, it will appear as if the cloth is being blown on by the wind. When "W" is released, this breeze disappears. I did this by adding a small random backwards velocity to the particles in the cloth while "W" is pressed. 

I thought this lab was cool, and doing the pendulum system first definitely helped with making sure the cloth node would work.
